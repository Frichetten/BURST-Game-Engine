A 2D game engine written in C/C++ and uses the SFML media libraries, and is developed in Visual Studio 2015.

Work in progress (it's a gif so it's a little choppy)

The target for the engine is to develop top-down, stock-and-flow games (think Civilization, or SimCity). The player will interact with various levels of UI to build, and create cities and towns. On a more technical level, this will be an opportunity to work on a piece of software using a low-level language like C and C++.
