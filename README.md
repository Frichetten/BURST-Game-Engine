# BURST Game Engine
A 2D Hack-n-Slash game engine written in C++ and uses the SFML media libraries, and is developed in Visual Studio 2015.

This game engine will be rather grand in scale (at least for a first time game in an unfamiliar framework). The goal is a 2D, Hack-n-Slash. To avoid feature creep and spaghetti code it is important to develop the game in modules, and tighten up the features as I go along. First, the engine will need to be developed, then the interface, followed by art assets. For a full change log see below.
